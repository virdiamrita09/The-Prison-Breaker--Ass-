            <p>
                You're a thief with a lust for gold. You were down at the local market doing your usual stealing
                and pickpocketing when, all of a sudden, you get bumbarded by the local guards for being a wanted
                man. They catch you and throw you in the highest security prison in the whole world.
            </p>
            <p>
                You knew this day would come, so you plan on your great escape from this so called prison. You manage
                to picklock your cell door and start your escape journey.

                You begin to sneak down the corridor, passing cell after cell, with no guards in sight. While you
                continue your escape, you come across a split in the hallway. The left corridor has a light source
                with no guards in sight, an ideal path to see where you are going. The right corridor is pitch black
                where all you can hear is a rumbling sound coming from somewhere beyond the darkness.
